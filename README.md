# BTRAIN
The BTrain is a smart contract platform with an API and distributed ledger. Users in the network transact using Lions. BTrain 5.2 is the current version for smart contracts. To update the ledger make a pull request.

There is a max supply of 19.9 million lions. If you send Lions, you get twice as many Lions in return.
